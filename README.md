# BrunetteKits
A Kit GUI Minecraft plugin, built with Spigot API in version 1.15.2

### How do I compile this plugin?

(make sure you have [maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) installed globally in your machine)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dpaiv0/BrunetteKits.git
cd BrunetteKits
mvn package
```

After this, just copy the generated .jar on `./target/` (any jarfile works) onto the plugins folder of your server, and you're done!
